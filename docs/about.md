# About Specter

Specter is a local-first execution agent designed for production-grade task orchestration. It emphasizes deterministic execution, strong auditability, and minimal infrastructure requirements. The system compiles natural language intent into directed execution graphs, runs tasks in parallel, and stores every trace for replay.

## Goals
- Replace opaque chat workflows with execution graphs
- Make automation transparent and auditable
- Keep deployments lightweight and inexpensive
- Provide a reliable foundation for human-in-the-loop operations

## Non-Goals
- Massive multi-tenant orchestration
- Heavy external dependencies for core execution
- Black-box automation without traceability
