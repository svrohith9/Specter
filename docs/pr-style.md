# PR Style Guide

## Scope
- Keep each PR focused on a single change or outcome
- Avoid mixing refactors with feature work

## Required Sections
- Summary
- Why this change is needed
- How it was tested
- Risk assessment

## Quality Bar
- Tests updated or added
- Docs updated for user-facing changes
- No secrets or credentials committed

## Review Expectations
- Prefer smaller PRs (< 300 lines) unless necessary
- Call out performance or compatibility risks explicitly
